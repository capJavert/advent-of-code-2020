### Update #5: First killer of the year. Got it after a long weekend of work (hrcmszenalaunch).
### Update #6: Finished 13th day and second week of AOC2020.. Today I learned about [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIFehsBHB8o).. did not really help me solve this (AOC subreddit did) but it is an interesting Math concept!

### Update #10 Backtracking through missed days.. finished 17th day.. [John Conway rules!](https://playgameoflife.com/)
### Update #11: 19th day... I did not know there is such thing as recursive regex.. JavaScript does not support it though :(
### Update #12: Still backtracking.. managed to solve 19th, 22th and 23th day today. Now I am 2 days behind. Let's see if I can suprise myself and manage to solve everything before Xmas!
