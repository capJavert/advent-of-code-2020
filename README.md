### Update #5: First killer of the year. Got it after a long weekend of work (hrcmszenalaunch).
### Update #6: Finished 13th day and second week of AOC2020.. Today I learned about [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIFehsBHB8o).. did not really help me solve this (AOC subreddit did) but it is an interesting Math concept!
